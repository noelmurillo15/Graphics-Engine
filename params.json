I also made an objloader that rendered indexed models which were loaded from files using multithreading.\r\nI created pixel and vertex shaders for ambient, spot, directional and point lights. I also added normal mapping using the shaders. I was able to draw multiple instances of a tree model and used frustum culling technique to optimize my renderer.\r\n\r\n### Author\r\nAllan Murillo (@noelmurillo15)\r\n",
